# Simulator for "Model-based Machine Learning for Beamforming Design in Multi-user Multi-Target JCAS Systems"

### Important information

We use python 3.12 and Pytorch 2.4 and for simulations.
....



# How to start a simulation
Download the whole project to your local worksation.

Run the 'TC_Fig.py' and 'Converg_Fig.py'. You will get the figures of convergence, time cost, and SINR(SCNR) comparison.

## Deep unfolding for  hybrid beamformining design
Run the 'main.py' in the file *Deep_unfolding* and you will get the data that can be compared to other schemes.



The simulator runs with predefined parameters. You can specify your own system and simulation parameters. More details about the parameters are suggestted to read the paper. 

We highly recommend you to execute the code step-by-step (using PyCharm's debug mode) in order to get a detailed understanding of the simulator.
